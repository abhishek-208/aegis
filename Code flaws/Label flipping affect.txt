3. The Label Flipping Blind SpotYou mentioned you haven't tested Label Flipping.Why it matters: Mean Shift is a "magnitude" attack—it tries to pull the model far away. Label Flipping is a "direction" attack. A client training "1" as "7" might produce a gradient vector that has a normal L2 distance (magnitude) but points in the wrong direction.The Flaw: If Aegis only looks at Euclidean distance ($S_k$) from the Median, it might miss Label Flipping because the "poisoned" update sits comfortably within the statistical radius of honest updates. You might need Cosine Similarity checking, not just Euclidean distance.
