1. The "MAD" Fallacy in Non-IID SettingsYou claim to have tuned the MAD threshold ($3.0 \times \sigma$) to handle Pathological Non-IID splits.The Truth: In a true Pathological Non-IID setting (e.g., Client A has only 'Cats', Client B has only 'Dogs'), the gradient updates are not Gaussian. They are often multimodal.The Risk: A standard MAD filter assumes a unimodal distribution centered around the truth. If your distribution is bimodal (due to extreme data heterogeneity), the "Median" might land in the empty space between the two modes, and the MAD filter will reject both honest clusters as outliers.The Test: You need to plot the histogram of the L2 norms of the updates in a high-heterogeneity round. If it looks like a camel's back (two humps), your "Iron Gate" is actually a guillotine for honest data.
